    <definition>The content uses the wrong grammatical register, such as using informal pronouns or verb forms when their formal counterparts are required.</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>For cases of general stylistic formality that do not involve the incorrect use of grammatical markers of formality, //register// should be used instead.</note>

      <definition>An unambiguous source text is translated ambiguously</definition>
      <notes>
        <note>This issue is distinct from //ambiguity// in that it is limited to issues where the translation process has introduced the ambiguity.</note>

      <notes>
        <note>This issue is not used for incorrect use of individual terms, which would be classified in //terminology// or one of its children. Rather, it is used for cases where a translation might appear to be correct but where it ends up misconveying information about a technical subject.</note>
        <note>Instances of this issue may point to confusing source materials or to lack of translator experience in a specialized domain.</note>
      </notes>
      <examples>
        <example>A physics text describes the interaction of subatomic particles in a medical scanning device. The translation seems plausible, but incorrectly conveys the relationship of two particles and is therefore incorrect.</example>
        <example>A source text describes how a <em>piano action</em> (the mechanism connecting a piano key to the hammer that strikes a string) is translated in a way that incorrectly conveys the relationship between two components.</example>

</issue>
<issue applies_to="source target" core="yes" id="style" name="Style">
  <definition>The text has stylistic problems.</definition>
  <examples>
    <example>The translation of a light-hearted and humorous advertising campaign is in a serious and “heavy” style even though specifications said it should match the style of the source text.</example>
  </examples>
  <issue applies_to="target" id="awkward" name="Awkward">
    <definition>A text is written with an awkward style</definition>
    <examples>
      <example>A text is written with many embedded clauses and an excessively wordy style. While the meaning can be understood, the text is very awkward and difficult to follow.</example>
    </examples>

  <issue applies_to="source target" id="inconsistent-style" name="Inconsistent style">
    <definition>Style is inconsistent within a text</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>Inconsistent style often emerges when multiple translators have worked on a single text. Because Inconsistent style applies to larger portions of texts, it would generally be assessed with a holistic metric rather than an analytic one.</note>
    </notes>
    <examples>
      <example>One part of a text is written in a light and “terse” style while other sections are written in a more wordy style.</example>
    </examples>

  <issue applies_to="source target" automatable="yes" core="yes" id="third-party-style" name="Third-party style">
    <definition>The text violates a third-party style guide</definition>
    <examples>
      <example>Specifications stated that English text was to be formatted according to the Chicago Manual of Style, but the text delivered followed the American Psychological Association style guide.</example>
    </examples>

  <issue applies_to="source target" id="unidiomatic" name="Unidiomatic">
    <definition>The content is grammatical, but not idiomatic</definition>
    <examples>
      <example>The following text appears in an English translation of a German letter: “We thanked him with heart” where “with heart” is an understandable, but non-idiomatic rendering, better stated as “heartily”.</example>

<issue applies_to="source target" core="yes" id="terminology" name="Terminology">
  <definition>A term (domain-specific word) is translated with a term other than the one expected for the domain or otherwise specified.</definition>
  <notes>
    <note>All issues specifically related to use of domain- or organization-specific terminology are included in this issue and its children.<br /><br />Do not use this issue if a text is simply mistranslated, i.e., if the translation would be a valid translation of the source but simply does not use the particular mandated terminology. For example, if a text translates <em>[river] bank</em> into Spanish as <em>banco</em> (a financial institution) instead of <em>orilla</em> (a river bank), this would be a //mistranslation// because <em>banco</em> would <em>never</em> be a valid term for the concept of a river bank. However, if a termbase specified that <em>orilla</em> should be used and the translation uses <em>ribera</em> instead, this would be a Terminology error because <em>ribera</em> is a valid term for the concept, but not the specified one.</note>
  </notes>
  <examples>
    <example>A French text translates English <em>e-mail</em> as <em>e-mail</em> but terminology guidelines mandated that <em>courriel</em> be used.</example>
    <example>The English musicological term <em>dog</em> is translated (literally) into German as <em>Hund</em> instead of as <em>Schnarre</em>, as specified in a terminology database.</example>
  </examples>
  <issue applies_to="source target" id="domain-terminology" name="Inconsistent with domain">
    <definition>A term is used contrary to general domain expectations</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>This issue is used for cases where no term-base is specified yet common domain conventions about terminology use are violated. If a termbase was specified and that term in question violates it, //termbase// should be used instead, if it is included in the metric (otherwise //terminology// would be used).</note>
    </notes>
    <examples>
      <example>A financial text is translated using “deduct” instead of “debit”. Although conceptually these could be synonyms in general language, “deduct” violated domain conventions.</example>
    </examples>
  </issue>
  <issue applies_to="source target" id="term-inconsistency" name="Inconsistent use of terminology">
    <definition>Terminology is used in an inconsistent manner within the text.</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>This issue and its children are used only to address inconsistent use of terminology. In cases where terminology is incorrect for the domain or termbase //termbase// or //domain-terminology// should be used instead. If further detail is needed about whether the source or target text is responsible for the inconsistent use terminology, use one of the daughter issues.</note>

      <definition>A single concept in the source text is expressed with multiple terms for the same concept.</definition>
      <notes>
        <note>Do not use this issue for cases where a single source term is translated in multiple ways in the target language content.</note>
      </notes>
      <examples>
        <example>A source text inconsistently uses “dog”, “buzzing bridge”, and “buzzer” for the component of a musical instrument.</example>

    <issue applies_to="target" id="multiple-translations-of-term" name="Multiple translations of same term">
      <definition>A single source term is translated in multiple inconsistent ways.</definition>
      <notes>
        <note>Applies to target text only since it refers to cases where one term has multiple translations. As with //term-inconsistency//, //termbase// or one of its children should be used instead if a termbase contains a specified term for a concept and the text does not use that particular term.</note>
      </notes>
      <examples>
        <example>A German source text uses one term for a component of a vehicle, but the target text uses “brake release lever”, “brake disengagement lever”, “manual brake release”, and “manual disengagement release” for this term in English.</example>

    <definition>A term is used inconsistently with a specified termbase</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>For obvious reasons, this issue type applies only in cases where a term is specified in a termbase that was specified for use. If general domain conventions for terminology are violated instead, then //domain-terminology// should be used instead, if it is included in a metric.</note>

    <definition>The content is not suitable for use by the end user, excluding problems related to suitability for the target locale.</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>If the issue relates to the applicability of the content to users in a particular locale, //locale-specific-content// should be used instead.</note>
      <note>End-user suitability generally applies to issues present in the source text, regardless of the target locale, but may apply in cases where there are distinct differences in audience or purpose between source and target.</note>

    <examples>
      <example>A text describes a process to repair a device, but following the instructions leads to serious damage to the device and potential injury.</example>

    <definition>A text does not meet legal requirements as set forth in the specifications.</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>Generally used in cases where the translation does not meet requirements. Cases in which the source text does not meet legal requirements are generally critical errors that will require rewriting the source text.</note>

    <examples>
      <example>Specifications stated that FCC regulatory notices be replaced by CE notices rather than translated, but they were translated instead, rendering the text legally problematic for use in Europe.</example>

    <definition>Content specific to the source locale does not apply to the intended target locale, audience, or purpose.</definition>
    <notes>
      <note>This issue type is distinguished from //locale-convention// in that this category applies to cases where text corresponds to the conventions of the target locale, but does not <em>apply</em> to the intended audience in the target locale. For example, if the Swedish advertising text mentioned above is properly translated and follows all mechanical locale conventions (e.g., using Swedish kronor instead of euros) but the offer does not apply to Sweden, //cocale-specific-content// should be chosen. If, however, the text applies to the locale, but does not follow locale conventions (e.g., numbers are formatted incorrectly for the locale), //locale-convention// should be used instead.</note>
    </notes>
    <examples>
      <example>An advertising text translated for Sweden refers to special offers available only in Germany and therefore is misleading.</example>
      <example>A manual for a printer sold in Spain describes features that apply only to versions of the printer sold in Japan and thus may confuse purchasers.</example>
